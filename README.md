# Pimp My Plus
This repo contains a bunch of scripts for downloading all of the classic mac software you could ever want and creating HD images with that software for use with SCSI2SD. No floppy disks required!

*NOTE:* The `driver.bin` file contains the SCSI driver that is installed to the disk by Apple HD SC Setup 7.3.5. The licensing of this driver is not clear. Please consider this before using this repo for commercial purposes.
